# Qiskit Applications Benchmarks

## Usage

In order to run benchmarks, run:

* Finance: `make benchmark TARGET=finance`
* Machine Learning: `make benchmark TARGET=machine_learning`
* Optimization: `make benchmark TARGET=optimization`
* Nature: `make benchmark TARGET=nature`

Before any benchmarking, you need to set once your machine info.
If you accept defaults, for finance for instance, run `make machine TARGET=finance ASVOPTS=--yes`
Another option is to run in development mode as a validation: `run benchmark_dev TARGET=machine_learning`
